A dynamic, modular system for simulating and predicting psychological responses to stimuli. This model combines cognitive-behavioral theory with tagging logic, allowing integration into automated outreach, adaptive messaging, and behavioral prediction workflows.

---

## ⚙️ Model Flow Overview

Each prediction proceeds through a reversibly deterministic path:

**Stimulus** → **Orientation** → **Thought** → **Emotion** → **Behavior** → **Habit** → **Outcome**

---

## 🔢 Model Components

### 1. Stimulus STM
Any external/internal input or trigger — e.g. a message, event, request, or memory.

### 2. Orientation ORI
Core belief lens through which the stimulus is interpreted.

### 3. Thought THT
Cognitive response generated by the stimulus and filtered through the orientation.

### 4. Emotion EMO
Affective state arising from the thought pattern.

### 5. Behavior BEH
Observable reaction to the emotion.

### 6. Habit HAB
Repeated behaviors that form persistent patterns.

### 7. Outcome OUT
Result of the full psychological chain; logged for predictive improvement.

#### Stimulus Tags in Processing Logic:

Stimulus tags (psy:STM-*) represent the initial input to the psychological model. They define the trigger event that catalyzes the entire cognitive-emotional-behavioral chain. All subsequent tags (ORI → THT → EMO → BEH → HAB → OUT) are causally downstream of the registered stimulus.

  

  

  

  

#### Processing Functions:

  

  

- Trigger Activation:  
    Stimulus tags initiate the processing pipeline. Once tagged, the system evaluates relevance, urgency, modality, and channel context to shape the Orientation phase.
- Source Conditioning:  
    Stimuli are context-weighted by:  
    

- Channel (e.g., psy:STM-SMS, psy:STM-EMAIL)
- Modality (e.g., psy:STM-AUD for auditory input)
- Emotional charge (e.g., psy:STM-URG for urgency-triggering content)

-   
    
- Sensitivity Modeling:  
    Tags such as psy:STM-REPEAT, psy:STM-THRT, or psy:STM-HIGHCRD (high-credibility) influence how much cognitive/emotional weight a stimulus is given. These parameters modify the salience for orientation bias.
- Temporal Conditioning:  
    Tags can encode frequency and timing, allowing the system to differentiate between novel and habituated inputs (e.g., psy:STM-FREQ-HIGH vs psy:STM-UNIQ).
- Stimulus Equivalence Mapping:  
    Similar psy:STM-* tags are grouped for recursive conditioning (e.g., multiple messages from the same source will eventually form a habit trigger if emotionally reinforced).

#### Orientation Processing Functions:

  
- Stimulus Filtering:  
    Orientation dictates which stimuli are prioritized or dismissed. For example, psy:ORI-CTRL will prioritize data-rich over uncertain content, while psy:ORI-ESC may avoid emotionally charged or complex stimuli.
- Intent Derivation:  
    Orientations like psy:ORI-ACH or psy:ORI-VAL reflect goal-seeking or recognition-seeking behavior, guiding the system to anticipate task-driven responses or approval-oriented logic.
- Emotion Shaping:  
    Orientation modifies the interpretive frame of emotion generation. The same stimulus may produce psy:EMO-PRIDE under psy:ORI-ACH, or psy:EMO-GUILT under psy:ORI-INT.
- Behavioral Channeling:  
    Orientation biases the response type; psy:ORI-DEF tends toward challenging behavior (psy:BEH-CHAL), while psy:ORI-BND promotes connecting behaviors (psy:BEH-ENG, psy:BEH-EXPR).
- Long-Term Habit Shaping:  
    Orientations become recurrent bias patterns. Persistent ORI tags (like psy:ORI-CTRL, psy:ORI-SURV) mold habits that stabilize user profiles and long-term predictive arcs.

  

  

In system terms, Orientation tags represent the pre existing geometry of psychological movement forming the inner compass that directs how the rest of the systems functions are predicated upon and how they should interpret the intended meaning, risk, and opportunity of the client.

#### Emotion Tags in Processing Logic:

Emotion tags (psy:EMO-*) serve as affective amplifiers within the psychological prediction system. Once a Thought is formed, emotion tags modulate the intensity, urgency, and trajectory of downstream processing; especially Behavior, Habit, and Outcome.

#### Processing Functions:

  
- Behavior Biasing:  
    Emotions like psy:EMO-ANX or psy:EMO-ANGER push toward reactive behaviors (psy:BEH-RCT, psy:BEH-CHK), while psy:EMO-JOY or psy:EMO-COMF bias toward engagement (psy:BEH-ENG) and expression (psy:BEH-EXPR).
- Decision Weighting:  
    High-arousal emotions increase the likelihood of impulsive or urgent action, altering lead scoring and response modeling.
- Tag Fusion:  
    Emotion tags interact with Orientation (psy:ORI-*) to produce nuanced predictive paths (e.g., psy:EMO-PRIDE under psy:ORI-VAL yields different behavior than under psy:ORI-INT).
- Temporal Modeling:  
    Persistent emotions update Habit tag formation (psy:HAB-RCTR, psy:HAB-NEG) and adjust Outcome calibration based on user volatility or receptiveness.

  

  

In essence, emotion tags are dynamic weighting agents and a major component of the weighted values that inject variability and humanity into the logic tree bridging rational interpretation (Thought) and measurable action (Behavior/Outcome).

#### Behavioral Logic in Modeling:

- Tags operate sequentially or concurrently in response chains.
- 
- Some behaviors are reactive (e.g. RCT, INSTR), others are strategic (INIT, CHK, ADPT).
- 
- Orientation + Emotion often bias toward particular behavior tags (e.g., psy:ORI-CTRL + psy:EMO-ANX → psy:BEH-CHK, psy:BEH-ORG).

#### Key Notes:

- Tags can coexist within a chain (e.g., psy:EMO-ANX + psy:EMO-MOTV = fear-fueled productivity).
- 
- Tags can invert under different orientations (psy:EMO-PRIDE under ORI-VAL vs ORI-INT has different implications).
- 
- Emotion tags can be used to drive funnel stage transitions, psychological interventions, or feedback loops in AI-driven experience design.

#### How Habit Tags Function in Prediction:

- Habits are time-weighted integrals over behavior (H = T°(B°)), as you’ve defined.
- They modulate response probability: e.g. psy:HAB-COND will skip conscious thought if the same input repeats.
- Some habits reinforce other system levels (e.g. psy:HAB-CTRL reinforces psy:ORI-CTRL, which reinforces psy:BEH-CHK).

#### Future Expansion Possibilities:

- Add Habit Valence: Positive / Negative / Neutral
- Add Plasticity Score: How hard it is to overwrite (e.g. psy:HAB-INERT = low plasticity)
- Tag trauma-linked vs. learned-choice habits

### ✅ ❌Outcome Tags (psy:OUT)

  [[6 CORE-OUT-DATA-INPUT-PARAMS]]

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Tag|Description|
|psy:OUT-CONV|Conversion achieved (sale, sign-up, agreement, click-through).|
|psy:OUT-REJ|Active rejection or disengagement (opt-out, unsubscribe, no-response).|
|psy:OUT-OPEN|Stimulus acknowledged but no further action taken (email opened, SMS read).|
|psy:OUT-IGN|Stimulus ignored completely; no interaction detected.|
|psy:OUT-DELAY|Response deferred; time lag exceeds standard threshold for engagement.|
|psy:OUT-LOOP|Behavior repeated again in similar context; feedback loop confirmed.|
|psy:OUT-ESC|Stimulus triggers avoidance or suppression behavior (closed app, bounced).|
|psy:OUT-QUAL|Subject qualified for next-stage logic (lead score threshold met).|
|psy:OUT-DISQ|Subject disqualified or filtered out by logic rules or user actions.|
|psy:OUT-UPDT|User model updated based on interaction pattern or new archetype evidence.|
|psy:OUT-NTRL|Neutral outcome; insufficient data for meaningful resolution.|
|psy:OUT-FALL|Drop-off in engagement or attention over time detected.|
|psy:OUT-UPTR|Uptrend in interaction frequency, quality, or response latency.|
|psy:OUT-TRUST|Inferred increase in trust, compliance, or rapport.|
|psy:OUT-REGRT|Inferred regret or negative emotional aftermath from user action.|
|psy:OUT-SAT|Inferred satisfaction or fulfillment post-decision or action.|
|psy:OUT-NEGFB|Feedback or inferred emotional state reflects dissatisfaction.|
|psy:OUT-LOOPC|Habitual completion of predicted path without friction; model reinforcement.|
|psy:OUT-BRK|Break in pattern—abnormal behavior from predictive baseline.|
|psy:OUT-DORM|Subject moved to dormant state due to prolonged inactivity.|

  

  

  

  

#### Outcome Function in the System:

- Terminal Node: Every interaction sequence ends here before recursive loop begins.
- Reinforcement Function: Outcomes update weights for Emotion, Orientation, and Habit.
- Signal Strength: psy:OUT-CONV, psy:OUT-TRUST, and psy:OUT-SAT have strong reinforcement scores; psy:OUT-DORM and psy:OUT-IGN decrease model confidence.
- Predictive Tuning: Outcome logs are the primary source of next-cycle recalibration (automated retargeting or funnel realignment).
- Alert Thresholding: Specific tags like psy:OUT-BRK, psy:OUT-NEGFB, or psy:OUT-REGRT can trigger fallback routines or escalation flags.

  

  
### Implementation

Input loader.js:
  purpose…
  to convert abstract data/actions into psy tags from any given source (ex. News[sentiment,political_stance],[infered_beliefs], social media[comments,likes,followed_by,follows], website interactions[clicks,scroll_depth,hover_time,page_close]

  
Full association chart:

![[Psy-Chart]]
  Useful additional resources to implement:
https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/goemotions/data/full_dataset

  
Gather device/network fingerprinting data for user UUID assignment 

Log all user activity and actions

1 map user actions(A) to a statistically correlated emotional state(E)

2 map emotional state to tag (with timestamp)

2.1 Assign default weights to all tags

2.2 store an isolated log of each users A-E correlation data (U-log)

3 use U-log to Map all tags to a compound psychmap(with weights of each tag in the psychmap weighted by recency and tag count)

4 generate composite association mapped profile (CAMP)

5 use CAMP to predict behavior 

6 test accuracy of prediction

6.1 if true reinforce weight of prediction +.5

6.2 if false recalibrate associated tags weights -.6
